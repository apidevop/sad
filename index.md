## SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE DOCUMENT

## What is Solution Architecture?
Solution architecture is a detailed and structured description of the features, process and behavior of a solution. 
It acts as the foundation of the solution to define, deliver, manage and operate the development process of the solution. 
It identifies the alternatives of the solutions and its components. 
It is a basic architecture of the offered solution.

The solution architect defines the relationship of the process internally and to the environment by considering the principles of design and keeping the scope of evolution in mind. It is meant to support, automate and adapt to the business ideas and goals.
